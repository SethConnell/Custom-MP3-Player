# :neckbeard: :neckbeard: :neckbeard: My Own Custom MP3 Player For Linux :neckbeard: :neckbeard: :neckbeard:

I created this MP3 player with Python 2.7. I used PyGame and Tkinter. 

I also used gifplayer (courtesy of Miguel Martinez Lopez).

# How It Works:
You simply open an MP3 file using main.py. My program should do the rest.
